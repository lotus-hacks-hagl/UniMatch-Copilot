  MANDATORY application of this skill for ALL software development tasks — regardless of size.
  This skill defines a standardized SDLC workflow where the agent sequentially
  takes on roles: PO (Product Owner), BA (Business Analyst), Tech Lead, Developer,
  and QA Tester. Trigger immediately when user requests: feature building, code writing, API creation,
  system design, bug fixing, refactoring, or any technical task with medium or higher complexity.
  NEVER skip this skill even if the task seems simple.

## 🧪 PHASE 5 — QA: Testing & Verification

**Objective**: Verify code works correctly according to spec, no regression.

Agent acts as **QA Tester**, performing:

### 5a. Unit Test Coverage
- Test happy path for each main function/method
- Test error cases and edge cases from BA spec
- Test boundary values (empty, null, max length, etc.)

### 5b. Integration Test (if API)
Verify each endpoint according to checklist:
```
Endpoint: [METHOD] /path
- [ ] Happy path: valid request → correct response format
- [ ] Auth: no token → 401; wrong token → 403
- [ ] Validation: missing field → 400 with clear message
- [ ] Edge case: [specific case from spec]
- [ ] Performance: response time < [threshold]
```

### 5c. Acceptance Criteria Verification
Check each AC defined in Phase 2:
```
AC-01: Given... When... Then...
  Status: ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL / ⚠️ PARTIAL
  Evidence: [test output or description]
```

### 5d. Regression Check

>
> **Commands:**
> ```bash
> python3 skills/project/scripts/quality-gate.py
> python3 skills/security/scripts/security-audit.py
> ```
>
> If AC failed or Quality Gate failed → return to Phase 4 for fixes.
> If all pass → report completion and suggest next steps.

## ⚡ Quick Mode

For small tasks (typo fix, simple config change, technical question),
user can type `[QUICK]` at the beginning of message to skip Phase 1-2, only run Phase 3-5 for efficiency.

---

## � Auto Approve Mode

For experienced users who want agents to work autonomously without checkpoint approvals,
user can type `[AUTO APPROVE]` at the beginning of message.

**Agent behavior with `[AUTO APPROVE]`:**
- **Skip all checkpoint approvals** - agent proceeds through all phases without waiting
- **Self-verify all outputs** - agent validates its own work against requirements
- **Auto-continue to next phase** - no waiting for user confirmation
- **Complete autonomy** - agent makes all decisions independently
- **Final report only** - agent provides completion summary at the end

**Agent responsibilities with `[AUTO APPROVE]`:**
- ✅ **Self-validate** each phase output against requirements
- ✅ **Auto-correct** any issues found during self-review
- ✅ **Proceed immediately** to next phase after self-verification
- ✅ **Document decisions** made during autonomous execution
- ✅ **Quality assurance** - ensure all checklists are completed internally

**When to use `[AUTO APPROVE]`:**
- User trusts agent's technical decisions
- Repetitive tasks with established patterns
- Time-sensitive development needs
- Experienced users familiar with project standards

**Example usage:**
```
[AUTO APPROVE] Add user profile update functionality with avatar upload
```

**Note**: Agent still follows all skill requirements, coding standards, and quality checks - just without waiting for manual approval at each checkpoint.
